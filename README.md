I have been using a PC since the age of 4 (: I started learning layout (html, css) and js on my own in 2020, and also implemented several projects. I worked as a layout designer for 1 year. I also studied salesforce and apex. Due to my studies at the university, I had to take pause. Now, I am resolutely and actively developing. Since September 2022, I have been studying on Hexlet and implemented 2 projects.

Here are examples of some projects:

1. [Responsive layout with flex](https://github.com/peperopuripuri/CSS-adaptive-flex-practice)
2. [My first JS project before learning Hexlet](https://github.com/peperopuripuri/JS-practice)
3. [Brain Games](https://github.com/peperopuripuri/JS-practice)
Console game with 5 types of arithmetic jobs.
Stack: JS, Git, nodejs, npm
Skills gained:
◕ Better understanding of Git and the terminal
◕ Began to better understand the basic principles of JS

4. [Difference Calculator](https://github.com/peperopuripuri/Difference-Calculator)
A program that determines the difference between two data structures.
Supports JSON/YAML file formats and 3 output formats (plain, stylish, json).
Stack: JS, Git, nodejs, npm, lodash, commander
Skills gained:
◕ Work better with nodejs, npm
◕ Worked as a team with other Hexlet students
◕ Understanding trees, recursion and objects in JS

I am very interested in front-end and technology in general. I always try to fulfill the tasks assigned to me as quickly and efficiently as possible, with great zeal and interest. I want to develop in this area and grow as a specialist, I will be interested in any tasks. I can and love to work in a team. After completing Hexlet courses, I plan to expand my technology stack.
